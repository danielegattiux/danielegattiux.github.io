									<h3>The Problem</h3>		
										<article>
											
												
											
												<p>This was an internal project, commissioned by the marketing team. Their main issue was the high effort required to generate viable leads, which were almost exclusively obtained by direct outreach or word of mouth. The main goal was to leverage the website to turn it into an effective marketing channel. An additional objective was to refresh the website’s appearance to bring it more in line with the company’s application UI standards, which we had codified in a design system.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Due to the remote locations most of those sensors operated in (e.g. mines) connectivy was sporadic, so when a machine stopped reporting for a long period of time it was difficult to correctly identify the cause (e.g. sensor ran out of battery or fell off a machine, connectivity issues, malfunctions etc.);</li>
													<li>If the reporting inconsistencies were not spotted quickly, it could result in large data gaps over time;</li>
													<li>Troubleshooting the issue fell almost exclusively to MachineMax personnel, which was a drain on resources.</li>

									<h3>Discovery</h3>
									    
										<article>
										    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
										    <p class="image fit"><img src="images/ai-old.png" alt="" /></p>
											<p>The first step was evaluating the existing version of the website using the 10 NNG heuristic criteria , with a particular focus on #6 (Recognition Rather than Recall) and #8 (Aesthetic and Minimalist Design), given the nature of our goals. I identified these as the main issues:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Excessive page nesting, particularly in the products section, which made it harder and longer to access the most interesting information for prospective clients;</li>
												<li> Too many options in the main navigation menu, which hinders navigation by overwhelming users with choices;</li>
												<li> The layout required users to scroll too much due to overly large font/image/buttons, and caused most of the content to be “below the fold” on the most common screen sizes;</li>
												<li> Most pages were too busy, and included redundant content modules;</li>
												<li> Branding was dated and not in line with the design system (e.g. inconsistent fonts/colours/styles), layouts and graphics looked unbalanced and awkward;</li>
											</ul>
										
										</article>
										
										<article>
										    <h4>SEO and Content Review</h4>
											<p>The marketing manager reviewed the website content to verify whether it aligned with their goals, and to spot any potential gaps. They also commissioned a SEO review to a specialised agency to assess the potential for organic traffic growth. Their main findings were:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>In the “Products section”, there was a page for a service which the company no longer offered;</li>
												<li>Many content blocks were redudant as they were repeated like for like on several different pages of the website, including were there was no clear relationship between them and the main topic of the page itself. This not only impacted usability and user trust but also had a potentially adverse effect on SEO performance;</li>
												</li>The page hierarchy was ineffective for SEO purposes due to the lack of desirable keywords at the top level for the products section.</li>

									<h3>UX/UI Design and prototypes</h3>
									
										<article>
										<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
										
										<p>I created a new navigation structure for the website with fewer main navigation items (5 vs 8), 2 of which represent the company’s main commercial offerings (Software and Data), with no generic “Products” main section. This now allows users to access the datasets details page with one interaction (hover on the main menu and click one of the dropdown options) instead of three. The new structure also aligns with the SEO requirements.</p>
									
										<h4>Low-fi wireframes</h4>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/ai-wireframe-1.png" alt="" /></p>
										<p>I created low-fi wireframes representing what I thought the main content modules and page templates were going to be. I reviewed them with the marketing team and after some amendments, we used them as a basis to decide which page templates were needed and which pages would use each of them. We also planned which content blocks were needed for each page and mapped instances were content was missing, obsolete or insufficient.</p>
										
										<h4>High-fidelity mockups</h4>
										<p>I created high-fidelity mockups (with help from a junior designer), most of them with placeholder content as the actual assets (copy, photographs etc.) was being produced at the same time by the marketing team. </p>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/aitlweb-banner.jpg" alt="" /></p>
										<p>As soon as each template was completed, I reviewed it with the marketing and upper management teams for further improvements and populated it with the actual content. Finally, each mockup was reviewed by our chosen Web Developer to ensure feasibility and suggest any necessary changes prior to handover.</p>

										<p>During the build phase, I participated in early QA on code preview versions of each page template, to ensure alignment of the build with the UX goals.</p>

									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									
										<article>
										<h4>400% more qualified leads</h4>
										<p>The new version of the website is now live and has received positive feedback both internally and from new clients, but most importantly, it is now generating 4-5 qualified leads a month, mainly from prospective client cohorts which would not be worth targeting with active marketing activity, compared to less than 10/year which it would achieve previously. </p>
