									<h3>The Problem</h3>		
										<article>
											
												
											
												<p>When this project launched, the most unique data source for equipment activity on this platform was their proprietary battery-powered sensors, which have to be physically installed on each machine near the engine. This allows for the collection of a wealth of data that other sources (e.g. manufacturer’s telemetry) don’t provide, or that are only available at longer intervals. It also provides consistent data for mixed fleets of vehicles from different manufacturers. The sensors also report diagnostic information about themselves (especially battery levels). However, at this stage such information was only available via the backend and inaccessible to customers, which was causing some significant issues both for them and for MachineMax:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Due to the remote locations most of those sensors operated in (e.g. mines) connectivy was sporadic, so when a machine stopped reporting for a long period of time it was difficult to correctly identify the cause (e.g. sensor ran out of battery or fell off a machine, connectivity issues, malfunctions etc.);</li>
													<li>If the reporting inconsistencies were not spotted quickly, it could result in large data gaps over time;</li>
													<li>Troubleshooting the issue fell almost exclusively to MachineMax personnel, which was a drain on resources.</li>

									<h3>Discovery and User Research</h3>
									
										<article>
										    <p class="image fit"><img src="images/mm-user-research-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
											<p>I analysed feedback from various users and conducted a round of informal semi-structured interviews to ascertain what actions the users could perform to mitigate the known issues and what information we could provide to enable them. I then compiled the findings in a report to the product team which formed the basis of our plan of action for the project.</p>
											<p>After presenting these findings we decided that a new dedicated section was needed for device management on the platform, as the existing ones only dealt with the fleet or user management.  </p>

									<h3>UX/UI Design and prototypes</h3>
									
										<article>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/mm-wireframe-1.png" alt="" /></p>
										<p>I envisioned the feature as a dashboard, highlighting items that needed attention and could be actioned with significant benefits either by the user or by thei collaborators (e.g. site managers). Originally, due to permissions constraints, the feature was meant to be a sub-page of the Admin section, although I recommended making it a main section whenever possible.</p>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/mm-wireframe-2.png" alt="" /></p>
										<p>I created some low-fi wireframes to mock-up the page in different states to illustrate the desired layout and functionality. Those were reviewed with the rest of the product team and the engineers and their feedback used to improve the design in the next phase.</p>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/mm-wireframe-3.png" alt="" /></p>
										<p>As the UI could be executed using existing components and patterns, I proceeded to create detailed hi-fidelity mockups of the page and its individual components, detailing their different states, including mobile/tablet versions.</p>
										<p class="image fit"><img src="images/mmdm-dashboard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
										<p>I reviewed the designs with the product and development team, and made some UI improvements based on their feedback. We found a technical solution to allow the page to have its own main section, which I called “Sensors” to make it as intuitive as possible.</p>

									<h3>Usability testing</h3>
									
										<article>
										
										<p>I created a clickable prototype of the section and used it to conduct a round of usability testing with a sample of users. Testing didn’t highlight any particular usability issue in the designs, but it did solicit some ideas and requests for the development of a similar feature for other data sources, i.e. manufacturer’s telemetry and 3rd party tracking devices, which were added to the product backlog.</p>

									<h3>Code preview QA</h3>
									
										<article>
										
										<p>During the build phase, I participated in early QA on code preview versions of the product, to ensure alignment of the build with the UX goals and test functionality in a variety of situations (as I could connect the dashboard to real data sources from client accounts), and filed a few bug reports in the process.</p>

									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									
										<article>
										<h4>70% fewer support tickets</h4>
										<p>Support tickets related to sensor issues decreased by 70%, and were mostly confined to new users requiring more training and cases where the ultimate cause was known but required MachineMax intervention to resolve (e.g. the sensor needed to be replaced).</p>
										
										<h4>20% increase in user satisfaction</h4>
										<p>Customer success reported a 20% increase in user satisfaction with this feature. Surprisingly, this was driven in large part by site managers using the application on their mobile to check for anomalies that could be quickly resolved.</p>
