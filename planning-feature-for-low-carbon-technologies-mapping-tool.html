									<h3>The Problem</h3>		
										<article>
											
												
											
												<p>It is a relatively new product, the digital twin of a process its final users do not usually manage on their own, whereas the goal of the product is to be a self-service solution, the first of its kind at that. As a result, when the technology deployment planning feature (named “Projects”) was initially built (before my tenure) quite a few assumptions about what the users’ goals and needs consisted of were made, and has they started to use the product in anger, questions and feature requests started coming in thick.</p>

									<h3>Discovery and User Research</h3>
									
										<article>
										    	<p class="image fit">
												<img src="images/leapplus1.png" alt="" />
											    </p>
											<p>Rather than simply accommodate feature requests made by the users, I decided to analyse their feedback and run usability testing sessions with a panel of users representative of our main personas with the following goals:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Validate (or disprove) the initial assumptions;</li>
												<li>Identify any recurrent usability issues;</li>
												<li>Spot any functionality or data gaps;</li>
												<li>Compile a list of suggested follow up actions and submit it to the wider product team for grooming and prioritisation.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The results did validate the main assumption, i.e. that this feature was needed and deemed useful by the vast majority of the participants. I did, however, uncover some UI issues (mainly around element placement in the left and 								right sidebars) and functionality gaps (e.g. assets could not be mass-deployed to an area but only on buildings, deployment filtering was very limited, planning for new building developments was awkward, some error exception 								states were missing, to name a few).</p>
										
											<p>After presenting these findings to our stakeholders (the DNOs who had originally commissioned the tool) we decided a major upgrade to the “Projects” feature was needed to address all the issues we had identified. Working with the Product Managers, we then created epics and related user stories to plan for its delivery.</p>

									<h3>Usability testing</h3>
									
										<article>
										
										<p>I ran a second round of usability testing sessions, using the same scripts but a different user panel, this time on clickable Figma prototypes, with the goal of validating our new approach. The results were positive, although I did capture a few additional user needs which required additional data that was unavailable at the moment to be fulfilled (those were added to the backlog for later planning).</p>
